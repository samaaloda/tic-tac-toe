## **Description:** 
A classic game that's loved by all. The game is a 3 by 3 grid, where the goal is traditionally to 
beat your opponent by placing three of your marks in a straight line; either as a diagonal, 
horizontal or vertical lines. 

To make the game even more interesting, this version also includes the possibility to play in 3 
different modes: computer vs computer, human vs computer, and human vs human. Due to the 
integration of an AI component to always prioritize winning, it is impossible for a human
to win against the computer (test it out for yourself and try to prove me wrong!). 

A variation was made such that the game and its classes were extended to allow the game to
implement boards of up to 20 by 20 in size, and detect wins in straight lines of a number given
by user.
